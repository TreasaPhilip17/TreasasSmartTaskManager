## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project is Special

This is not just a to-do list.  
Itâ€™s a **smart, gamified, real-time productivity system** built during the Katomaran shortlisting challenge, using Replit's AI Agent from scratch.

I had **not much prior experience** with this platform â€” but within hours, I created something powerful, intuitive, and unique.
